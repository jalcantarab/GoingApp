\lettersection{About Me}
I am a curiosity-driven engineer with many competing interests. A solution architect, a thinker, an avid reader, a tester and a tinkerer. Throughout my work managing engineers in growing organizations, I became a highly efficient people manager and team builder, a great communicator \& a trustworthy product evangelist.

The hands-on experience I've accrued delivering software \& services to enterprise customers has been invaluable. Building great teams \& working with clients across the globe have sharpened my knack for managing engineering efforts with gleaning market insights from quantitative and qualitative data.

For the most part of my career, I have worked in small-size growing companies with international coverage, where navigating said growth; building, training \& re-structuring teams across time-zones have been constant duties.
