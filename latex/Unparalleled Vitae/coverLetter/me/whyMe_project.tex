\lettersection{Why Me?}
Because I will be an unrelenting force in executing your technical programs \& accelerating the pace at which your product integrations go live. I lead engineering teams independently and from the front. With these great teams I have built, owned, and continuously deliver software with sturdy results and minimum entropy.

I have a strong technical understanding of multiple engineering disciplines and excellent communication skills, which allows me to drive teams of diverse backgrounds \& establish credibility with clients and external audiences in either English or Spanish. 

Through robust, lasting technical solutions \& efficient communication I will work cross-functionally to help launch far-reaching programs, new products, features and services; and own the management of ongoing operational execution to the detail. I will help you focus on business-critical goals on aggressive timelines as your new \jobTitle.
