\lettersection{About Me}
I am a curiosity-driven engineer with managerial experience and a great interest in easing the life of users through technology. A solution architect, a thinker, an avid reader, a tester and a tinkerer.

The hands-on experience I've accrued delivering software at scale to enterprise customers has been invaluable. Working directly with great teams \& clients across the globe have sharpened a knack for managing engineering efforts with gleaning market insights from quantitative and qualitative data.

For the most part of my career, I have worked in small-size growing companies with international coverage, where navigating said growth; building, training \& re-structuring teams across the globe have been constant duties.
