Because I will be an unrelenting force in taking your product iterations to market. I lead engineering teams independently and from the front. With these great teams I have built, owned, and continuously deliver software with sturdy results and minimum entropy.

I have a strong technical understanding of multiple engineering disciplines and excellent communication skills, which allows me to drive teams of diverse backgrounds \& establish credibility with clients and external audiences. 

Through robust, lasting solutions I will help you focus on shipping features on aggressive timelines as your new \jobTitle.
