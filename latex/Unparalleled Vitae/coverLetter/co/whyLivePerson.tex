\lettersection{Why \companyName ?}
LivePerson is the company I admire the most in the vertical I've been working on for the last 4 years. I have a simple life mission I try to adhere as much as possible when considering a new position. To contribute to the reach and accessibility of technology. LivePerson is doing just that, leading the way on how businesses adopt omnichannel communication and automation of customer services. LivePerson integrations see existing business' margins grow and the cost of entry for new business lowered. This is a magnificent thing for a distributed economy, and represents the best of technology, disrupting without replacing, and creating opportunities by lowering the threshold of infrastructure needed to support large audiences.

I am looking forward to working with you on adding more intelligence to an established technology with a great list of customers, to contribute to the scalability of LivePerson, reduce the variable cost per project thanks to product flexibility. Allow me to help you create meaningful connections between end-users and our clients across channels.

I am extremely excited to contribute to this mission. I am confident that you will be able to quickly recognize the value I'll bring to the table from our first conversations.
