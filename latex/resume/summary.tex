Hi!, I'm an experienced Engineering Manager with a track record delivering projects \& products from conception to fruition; with most of my experience engineering solutions for enterprise applications and developing the products to transform the offering of the companies I've worked with. I am driven by curiosity to cultivate my genuine passion for engineering \& problem solving. My innate sociability has taken me on a managerial path where I've led Engineers teams to delivering hundreds of projects across the globe. And what I long for now is ever-more interesting problems, do you have any to share?
