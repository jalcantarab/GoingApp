For the most part of my career, I have worked in small-size growing companies with international coverage, where navigating said growth, building \& training teams across the globe have been constant duties.

I am a curiosity-driven engineer with many competing interests. A solution architect, a thinker, an avid reader, a tester and a tinkerer. Throughout my work in growing organizations
I've become a highly efficient manager and team builder. A great communicator, and an expert on putting out metaphorical fires. 
I do not limit myself to a position's responsibilities and will always be an engine for an organization's success, product evangelism & culture.

The hands-on experience I've accrued delivering software to businesses all over the world has been invaluable. Working directly with great teams & clients across the globe have sharpened a knack for managing engineering efforts with gleaning market insights from quantitative and qualitative data.
